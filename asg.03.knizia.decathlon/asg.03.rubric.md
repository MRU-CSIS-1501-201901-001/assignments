# Assignment 03 Rubric

Code is not only meant to be **run**; it's also meant to be **read**. As such, I consider it equally important that your code _does what it's supposed to do_ **AND** _be easy to read and understand_. The marking scheme reflects this.

An assignment is also an excellent opportunity to open up a conversation between a reader of the code (that's me) and the writer of the code (that's you). Getting feedback about what you've created - both the "good" and the "needs work" part - is super important. As such, instead of providing some quick cookie-cutter comments, I am willing (and eager!) to sit down with each student and go over their code with them. So if you want to have that conversation - and I hope you do - please contact me in person or by email after you get your marks back and we'll arrange a mutually-acceptable time when we can talk about your code.

### Grade Levels

#### A Level

> An A level requires that:
>
> - [ ] all Dice tests pass
> - [ ] all DiceCollection tests pass
> - [ ] all HighScores tests pass
> - [ ] all HighScoresPersistanator tests pass
> - [ ] the program validates all user input
> - [ ] at least one event from **each** category is playable
> - [ ] high score save/load functionality works
> - [ ] Javadocs are complete as per specifications
>
> Of course, to receive an A level, your code must also be easy to understand. Whether the A is an A-, A, or A+ depends on how well you followed the [design guidelines](design.guidelines.md).

#### B Level

> A B level requires that:
>
> - [ ] all Dice tests pass
> - [ ] all DiceCollection tests pass
> - [ ] all HighScores tests pass
> - [ ] all HighScoresPersistanator tests pass
> - [ ] the program validates all user input
> - [ ] at least one event from **2 of the 4 categories** is playable
> - [ ] high score save/load functionality works
> - [ ] Javadocs are complete as per specifications
>
> As with an A, whether you get a B+, B, or B- depends on how well you follow the design guidelines.

#### C Level

> A C level requires that:
>
> - [ ] all Dice tests pass
> - [ ] all DiceCollection tests pass
> - [ ] all HighScores tests pass
> - [ ] all HighScoresPersistanator tests pass
> - [ ] the program validates all user input
> - [ ] at least one event from **1 of the 4 categories** is playable
> - [ ] Javadocs are complete as per specifications
>
> As with an A, whether you get a C+, C, or C- depends on how well you follow the design guidelines.

#### D Level

> A D level requires that:
>
> - [ ] all Dice tests pass
> - [ ] all DiceCollection tests pass
> - [ ] all HighScores tests pass
> - [ ] all HighScoresPersistanator tests pass
> - [ ] the program validates all user input
> - [ ] the program uses a stubbed version of one event from **1 of the 4 categories**
>
> As with an A, whether you get a D+, D, or D- depends on how well you follow the design guidelines.

#### F Level

> You'll get an F is your submitted code doesn't compile.
>
> You'll get an F if you didn't hand anything in.
>
> You'll also get an F if you're wildly off-base.
